                    <p>Java is a very powerful Object-Oriented-Programming Language (OOP) developed by James Gosling in 1995. It was firstly named as 'Oak' after the Gosling saw an Oak Tree outsided of his office. How ironic is that?</p>
                    <p>Java Philosophy's <em>'write once run anywhere'</em> (WORA) becomes the reason why the language has become so popular. It was used mostly in modern Software Applications. Even in today's world, there's still a number of Websites and Desktop Application that will not function without Java supporting it. Here's some more technology that Java is used for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mobile Applications (especially Androind apps)</li>
                        <li>Desktop Applications</li>
                        <li>Website Applications</li>
                        <li>Web servers and application servers</li>
                        <li>and much, much more!</li>

                </article>
                <ul>
                    <li>In learning Java you will venture the path of learning and understanding OOP to its fundamental core;</li>
                    <li>You will straightly deep dive to the concept of OOP as you start learning it.</li>
                    <li>Most important of all, you will uncover how transformative OOP is, and its difference compared to sequential programming.</li>

                <header>Is JavaScript and Java the same?</header>
                <article>
                    <p>JavaScript and Java are both incredibly fruitful Computer Programming Languages that are both utilized massively in the present and well-informed world. Even though they are comparative to one another because of the similarities they both possesses, fundamentally, both are different from one another.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript is an object-oriented, high-level, often just-in-time compiled programming language that transform and brought significant changes into the Web Development industry. It was firstly named as <em>LiveScript</em> in 1995. Since LiveScript back then showed a lot of similarties, including expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow with the uprising and still developing Java it was then renamed as JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, Java is a statically typed language with a huge variety of varibles, has good memory management ensuring the runtime of every program, and a collection of ready to use robust libraries that handle various tasks.</p>

                        <li>Java Development Kit (JDK) it is a complete package that equips developers with necessary tools and resources to create, compile, and run Java-based applications or softwares.</li>
                        <li>Java Runtime Environment (JRE) solely used for the purpose of executing Java applications or softwares. It includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for executing bytecode and the essential libraries that Java applications commonly rely on</li>
                        <li>Bytecode This is the representation of a Java source code after it gets compiled. This bytecode is not machine-specific, meaning it is not tied to a particular computer architecture. Instead, it is designed to be executed by a virtual machine, specifically the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</li>
                        <li>Java Virtual Machine (JVM) this provides a virtual environment for Java Applications to run on device or operating system without modification. JVM is platform dependent, and it interprets the compiled Java bytecode and translates it into machine-specific code at a runtime.</li>

                <article>
                    <p>Think of variables as a container that will hold the values that's passed unto them. Just like any physical container in real-world, a Java variable should be placed or <em>declared</em> properly. Each varibale only expect to take one specific <em>data type</em>, just like in real-life, a container for salt and sugar should be separated.</p>
                    <p>Variables are very imporatant part of every programming languages, they are usually the one's being manipulated by the developer or programmer to accomplish the main goal of the whole program. You will learn more about variables and the different type of data types on the next section</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Here's some widely used data type in Java</p>
                    <p>
                        Boolean data type:
                        <code>
    bool myBoolVariable = false;
                        </code>
                        Data type such as this are commonly use to hold true or false values.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Byte data type:
                        <code>
    byte myByteVariable = (byte)0;
                        </code>
                        This one is commonly used for the purpose saving memory on large size arrays.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Short data type:
                        <code>
    short myShortVariable = (short)0;
                        </code>
                        Used to store short sized integers, mainly for the purpose of saving memory.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Integer data type:
                        <code>
    int myIntVariable = 24;
                        </code>
                        One of the mostly used data type in any programming language, as a beginner, you will be mostly using this.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Long data type:
                        <code>
    long myLongVariable = 24;
                        </code>
                        A bigger version of the integer data type that can store larger integer values.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Float data type:
                        <code>
    float myFloatVariable = 24.123f;
                        </code>
                        A data type that can hold decimal numbers or floating values
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Double data type:
                        <code>
    double myDoubleVariable = 24.123456;
                        </code>
                        Bigger version of the float data type.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Character data type:
                        <code>
    char myCharVariable = 'a';
                        </code>
                        Data type that can is used for holding single letter values.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        String data type:
                        <code>
    String myStringVariable = "apple";
                        </code>
                        And a data type that holds a series of characters also known as string.
